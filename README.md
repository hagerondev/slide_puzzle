## What's this?

This is an educational puzzle game. It is an application that reads a Japanese folktale called Momotaro, and puzzles appear at key points in the folktale. By solving the puzzles, the user can continue the story. This is a great way for children to develop their linguistic skills through exposure to English, and their mathematical skills through puzzle solving.
